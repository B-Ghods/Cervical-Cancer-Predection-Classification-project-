# Cervical-Cancer-Predection-Classification-project-
In this project, after analysing data, different methods are used to predict whether a person has a risk of having cervical cancer. Data was gathered from 858 patients and the effect of different features like 'Age', 'Number of sexual partners', 'First sexual intercourse' and 'Smokes' was investigated. After preparing data, methods such as GaussianNB, MultinomialNB and BernoulliNB are used to train and test data.
